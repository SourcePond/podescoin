	<!-- According to the CDI specification, this file must be present. This is necessary
	to let the CDI container know that this bundle is CDI enabled. No content is needed, i.e.
	configuration of the bundle is done through CDI annotations. Note: this file has no effect
	in a PAX-CDI/OSGi environment; determining CDI bundles is done there through special
